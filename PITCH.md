# Recall: Your Organization's Memory

## The Problem

**Your team's knowledge is disappearing.**

Every day, important conversations happen in Slack, email, meetings, and DMs. Decisions get made. Context gets shared. Problems get solved.

Then it's gone.

Six months later, someone asks: "Why did we choose this approach?" Nobody remembers. The person who made the decision left. The Slack thread is buried under 10,000 messages.

So you make the same mistakes again. You re-debate settled questions. You lose institutional knowledge every time someone leaves.

**This costs you time, money, and momentum.**

## The Solution

**Recall captures your organization's memory and makes it searchable.**

Instead of conversations disappearing into chat history, they become permanent, searchable knowledge. Instead of decisions being forgotten, they're tracked and explained. Instead of new hires asking the same questions, they search and find answers.

Recall is the single source of truth for:
- Why decisions were made
- What was tried and didn't work
- Who knows what
- How things evolved over time

## How It Works

### 1. Capture Conversations
Post updates, ask questions, propose ideas, and document decisions. Everything is structured and searchable from day one.

### 2. Track Decisions
Convert important conversations into tracked decisions. See who decided, when, why, and what alternatives were considered.

### 3. Search Everything
Ask questions in natural language. Get instant answers with sources. Find that conversation from 8 months ago in seconds.

### 4. Build Institutional Memory
New hires search instead of asking. Teams reference past decisions. Knowledge compounds instead of evaporating.

## Why Teams Choose Recall

### For Engineering Teams
- Document technical decisions (ADR format)
- Track why architecture choices were made
- Onboard new developers faster
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Link decisions to code (PRs, commits, docs)

### For Product Teams
- Capture product decisions and rationale
- Track feature proposals and outcomes
- Search past customer feedback
- Document what was tried and learned
- Build product knowledge over time

### For Leadership
- See decision history and impact
- Understand team priorities
- Track organizational evolution
- Reduce meeting overhead
- Preserve knowledge when people leave

### For Remote Teams
- Async-first communication
- Timezone-friendly discussions
- Permanent record of context
- Searchable team knowledge
- Transparent decision-making

## What Makes Recall Different

### Not Another Chat Tool
Slack is for quick conversations. Recall is for knowledge that matters. Conversations are structured, searchable, and permanent.

### Not Another Wiki
Wikis require manual documentation. Recall captures knowledge as it happens. No extra work, no outdated docs.

### Not Another Project Manager
Jira tracks tasks. Recall tracks why. The context, decisions, and reasoning behind the work.

### AI-Native, Not AI-Bolted-On
Built from the ground up with AI. Automatic summaries, smart search, decision extraction, and knowledge insights.

## Real Impact

**Before Recall:**
- "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?" → Nobody remembers
- "Has anyone tried this before?" → Ask around, maybe get an answer
- New hire asks question → Someone explains for the 10th time
- Important decision made → Lost in Slack within a week

**After Recall:**
- "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?" → Search, find decision with full context
- "Has anyone tried this before?" → Search, find 3 past attempts with outcomes
- New hire asks question → Search finds answer with examples
- Important decision made → Tracked, searchable, referenced forever

### Remote Company (50 people)

## Common Objections

**"We already use Slack/Teams"**
Great! Recall complements chat. Use Slack for quick questions, Recall for knowledge that matters.

**"We already have a wiki"**
Wikis require manual work and get outdated. Recall captures knowledge automatically as conversations happen.

**"We're too small"**
If you're making decisions and want to remember why, you need Recall. Size doesn't matter, memory does.

**"We don't have time to learn new tools"**
Recall is simpler than Slack. Post, reply, search. That's it. No training needed.

**"What about data privacy?"**
Your data is completely isolated. We can't see it. You can export or delete anytime.
